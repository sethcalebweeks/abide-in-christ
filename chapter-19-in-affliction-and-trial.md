# Chapter 19: In Affliction and Trial

_"Every branch that bearest fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit."--John 15:2_

The vine is the perfect picture of how we should relate to God. No other plant has such a lively and refreshing fruit and juice. But no other plant also has such a bad tendency to grow useless wood that can only be burned. The vine needs constant and careful pruning more than any other plant. But it also rewards the gardener with a rich harvest. In His amazing story, Jesus tells us about this need for pruning in the vine, and how it blesses us. This one word gives us so much light and hope in this dark world, where believers face so much pain and sorrow! It shows us how each trouble we face is a chance for us to grow closer to God. Yes, friend, especially when you are going through hard times, stay connected to Jesus.

Abide in Christ! This is what God wants for you when He allows you to face difficulties. The tree grows stronger roots in the storm; the people stay inside and enjoy the shelter of their house in the hurricane. In the same way, God uses our troubles to draw us closer to His love. Our hearts often wander away from Him; we get too comfortable and satisfied with worldly things, and we lose our spiritual sensitivity and intimacy with Him. It is a great blessing that God comes with His discipline, makes everything around us seem dark and dull, shows us how sinful we are, and takes away our joy in what was becoming harmful for us. He does this so that we can find our peace in Christ in our time of trouble, and learn to choose staying connected to Him as our only treasure. And when the trouble is over, we will have grown more attached to Him, so that even in good times He will still be our only joy. He loves us so much that He will not spare us from any pain if it can help us come back home and stay connected to His beloved Son. Friend! Ask God for grace to see every trouble, big or small, as His way of pointing you to Jesus, and saying: Stay connected to Him.

Abide in Christ: this is how you will receive all the wonderful blessings God has for you in your suffering. You will understand God’s wise purposes better, you will be more confident of His unchanging love, and you will experience His Spirit making you more like Him. Abide in Christ: your suffering becomes a way of sharing in His suffering, and knowing more about His cross–the curse He took for you, the death to sin He gives you, the love He shows you as He feels all your sorrows. Abide in Christ: as you become more like your Lord in His suffering, you will also know more of His love and reality. Abide in Christ: in the fiery trial, you will see Him with you like never before; He will purify your heart and make you reflect His image. O abide in Christ: the power of sin will be weakened, the selfishness and stubbornness of your old nature will be humbled, to make room for His kindness and gentleness. A believer may go through a lot of suffering, but miss out on much of its benefit. Abiding in Christ is the secret of getting all that God meant for us through our suffering.

Abide in Christ: this is how you will find true and lasting comfort. Some people look for comfort first, and the benefit of suffering second. But God loves us so much that He wants our real and lasting benefit first, and He doesn’t forget to comfort us too. When He comforts us, it is to draw our hurting hearts to Himself to receive His blessing in relationship with Him; when He doesn’t comfort us right away, His goal is still the same. It is by making us more like Him that true comfort comes. The Holy Spirit is the Comforter, not only because He can remind us of God’s love, but more importantly, because He makes us holy and brings us closer to Christ and God. He teaches us to abide in Christ; and because God is there, the best comfort will come there too. In Christ we see the heart of the Father, and nothing can comfort more than resting in His arms. In Christ we see His love for us that combines His divine power with His human compassion–and what can comfort more than this? In Christ you see that He has given you much more than you have lost; He only took away from you what was keeping you from receiving more from Him. In Christ your suffering becomes sacred, meaning it becomes a way of showing your devotion to God and a taste of eternal glory; in suffering God’s Spirit fills you with His presence. Believer! do you want comfort in suffering?–Abide in Christ.

Abide in Christ: this is how you will produce a lot of fruit. The only reason people plant vines is to get fruit, and nothing else. Other trees may be planted for beauty, for shade, or for wood–but vines are only for fruit. And every vine owner is always looking for ways to make it produce more fruit, a lot of fruit. Friend! abide in Christ when you face hard times, and you will produce more fruit. You will experience Christ’s kindness and the Father’s love more deeply, and you will want to live for His glory. You will give up your self and your own desires in suffering, and you will be ready to share with others who are hurting, just like Jesus did. You will understand why the Father prunes you to make you produce more fruit. You will offer yourself to Him again, and more than ever before, and you will say that now you have only one goal in life–to show and share His amazing love with others. You will learn the wonderful skill of forgetting yourself, and even in hard times, use your time away from normal life to pray for others’ well-being. Dear Christian, abide in Christ in hard times. When you see them coming, meet them in Christ; when they are here, feel that you are closer to Christ than to them, because He is closer to you than any hard time can be; when they are passing away, still abide in Him. And let the one thought of the Savior as He talks about pruning, and the one desire of the Father as He does pruning, be yours too: “Every branch that produces fruit He prunes so that it may produce more fruit.”

This is how your hard times will become your best times–getting ready for more fruitfulness than ever. Drawn into closer friendship with the Son of God, and deeper experience of His love and grace–settled in the wonderful assurance that He and you totally belong to each other–more fully satisfied with Him and more completely given to Him than ever before–with your own desires dying again, and your heart brought into better agreement with God’s desires–you will be a clean vessel, ready for the Master’s use, prepared for every good work. True believer! O try and learn this amazing truth, that in hard times your first, your only, your awesome calling is to abide in Christ. Spend a lot of time with Him alone. Be careful of the comfort and the distractions that friends often bring. Let Jesus Christ Himself be your main companion and comforter. Enjoy the promise that closer union with Him, and more fruit through Him, are sure to come from hard times, because it is the Husbandman Himself who is pruning, and will make sure that you get what you want when you give yourself lovingly to His work.
