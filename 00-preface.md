Throughout Jesus' time on Earth, He most often spoke of the close relationship between Himself and His disciples with the phrase "Follow me." Before ascending to Heaven, He gave them a more intimate and spiritual phrase to express their connection in glory, which was "Abide in me."

It is worrying that there are many devoted followers of Jesus who are not aware of the significance of the phrase "Abide in me" and the joy it promises. They trust in Jesus for forgiveness and support, and try to obey Him to some degree. But they do not understand how close the union with Him can be, how intimate the fellowship can be, and what an amazing unity of life and purpose it brings. This is a great loss to them personally, but also to the Church and the world.

If we ask why those who have accepted the Savior and been made partakers of the Holy Spirit do not receive the full salvation prepared for them, ignorance is often the cause of their unbelief. If the abiding in Christ, the living union with Him, and the experience of His continual presence and preserving were preached in our churches with the same clarity and importance as His atonement and pardon through His blood, I am sure many would happily accept the invitation to such a life. Its influence would be visible in their experience of purity and power, love and joy, fruit-bearing, and all the blessings the Savior gives us through abiding in Him.

It is with the desire to help those who have yet to understand fully what the Savior meant with His command, or who fear it is beyond their reach, that this book has been published. Just as it takes frequent repetition for a child to learn their lessons, the believer must meditate on the lessons of faith for a period of time in order to fully grasp them. I hope that especially young believers will find it helpful to spend each day for a month repeating the words "Abide in me" and the accompanying parable of the Vine. Throughout this book, we will understand how this promise-precept applies to us, the grace that makes it possible to obey, how essential the experience of its blessing is to a healthy Christian life, and the blessings that come from it. By listening, meditating, praying, and surrendering ourselves to Jesus, the Holy Spirit will give life to the word, and through it will come the faith that grasps the desired blessing.

I earnestly pray that our gracious Lord may bless this little book and help those who seek to know Him, as He has already blessed the original Dutch version. I pray even more fervently that He would make His beloved children, who are still living divided lives, see how He desires them to surrender themselves to Him completely and how doing so brings immense joy and glory. May those of us who have already begun to experience the sweetness of this life fully commit to be witnesses of the grace and power of our Lord to keep us united with Him, and try to persuade others to follow Him completely. We can only maintain our abiding by producing such fruit.

Finally, I would like to offer my reader one word of advice. It is this: it takes time to grow into Jesus the Vine. Don't expect to be deeply rooted in Him unless you are willing to give Him that time. Simply reading God's Word or this book and asking God for His blessing is not enough. We must take time each day to spend with Jesus and with God. Just like we all need time every day to eat our mealsâ€”rushing through our food is not enough. If we want to live through Jesus, we must feed on Him (John 6:57). We must absorb and digest the heavenly food that the Father has provided. So, dear reader, if you want to learn to abide in Jesus, take time each day before, during, and after you read to connect with the living Jesus and to consciously give yourself to His blessed influence. This will give Him the opportunity to take hold of you, pull you up and keep you safe in His almighty life.

And now, to all God's children whom He gave me the privilege of pointing to the Heavenly Vine, I offer my fraternal love and salutations. I pray that each one of them may be blessed with the richness and fullness of abiding in Christ. May the grace of Jesus, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be their daily portion. Amen.
