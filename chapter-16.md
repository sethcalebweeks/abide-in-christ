# Chapter 16: Forsaking All for Him

Where there is life, there is a constant exchange of what comes in and goes out, receiving and giving. The food I eat fuels the work I do. The things I experience shape my thoughts and feelings. The ability to give depends on the ability to receive. Through the healthy exercise of giving and receiving, we may find fulfillment in life.

This also applies to our spiritual life. Some Christians believe that all spiritual joy comes from receiving only. However, they overlook that the capacity for receiving grows through consistent giving and releasing. When we empty ourselves of what we have, we create space for God's blessings to flow in. This was a concept that Jesus emphasized repeatedly. When he spoke of selling all to attain treasure, losing one's life to find it, and receiving a hundredfold by leaving everything behind, he was expressing the necessity of self-sacrifice as the rule of his kingdom, for himself and his disciples. To truly remain connected to Christ and have our life fully in him, we must, like Paul, acknowledge that "I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have lost all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ."

Let us examine what we must give up in order to follow Christ. First and foremost, we must give up sin. There can be no true conversion without giving up sin. However, new converts often don't understand what sin really is, the demands of God's holiness, or the extent to which Jesus can help them overcome it. As the Christian life progresses, there is a desire for a deeper purging of all that is unholy. When the desire to stay connected to Christ becomes strong, the soul realizes the need for a renewed act of surrender. This involves once again accepting and affirming their death to sin in Christ and letting go of everything that is sin. Using the power of God's Spirit, the believer makes a conscious decision to no longer serve sin, but instead to be a servant of righteousness. This decision is made with joy, knowing that every sin given up is a gain, creating space for the love and presence of Christ to fill their life.

After giving up sin, we must give up self-righteousness. Despite our efforts to reject our own accomplishments or merits, it often takes a long time before we truly understand what it means to deny self any place or right in serving God. Without realizing it, we permit our own thoughts, feelings, and actions to play a role in God's presence. We expect self to contribute in prayer and worship, Bible reading, and serving God, instead of relying solely on the Holy Spirit's guidance. It takes time to learn the lesson that "in my flesh, there is no good thing." As we learn this, and see that corruption affects everything that is natural, we understand that in order to fully remain in Christ, we must surrender everything in religion that is of self, including giving it up completely and waiting for the Holy Spirit to work in us and produce what is pleasing to God.

Our natural life, including all the abilities and blessings given to us by the Creator, as well as the activities and passions that surround us, requires more than just a sincere desire to serve the Lord. Simply wanting to use these gifts in God's service is commendable, but it is not enough to guide us or give us the strength to do so in a satisfactory way. The notion that once we are God's children, our gifts will automatically be used for His glory has caused great harm to the spiritual depth of the Church. Special grace is required for this, and that grace comes from sacrifice and surrender. I must recognize that my gifts and abilities, even as a child of God, are still tarnished by sin and controlled by the flesh. I cannot simply use them for God's glory; I must first present them to Christ to be cleansed and accepted by Him. I must feel powerless to use them correctly, and understand that they can be dangerous to me because they can easily allow the flesh and my old self to assert control. With this realization, I must give up these gifts entirely to the Lord. When He has accepted and marked them as His own, I receive them back, to hold them as His property, relying on Him for daily guidance and letting them be used only under His influence. Experience shows that the path of complete consecration leads to full salvation. Not only is what we give up returned to us, but giving everything up leads to receiving everything. As we let go of all things for Christ's sake, we are more fully in Him, and we find ourselves in Him.

The same idea applies to all the roles and possessions that God has entrusted to us. These could be things like the fishing nets on the Sea of Galilee, or the household chores of Martha of Bethany. For the disciples of Jesus, it also included their homes and friends. Jesus taught them, through His actions, that they must give everything up for Him. This was not just a random command, but a natural law that applied to the grace of His kingdom - the more completely we get rid of the old, the more fully we can be possessed by the new and experience a complete transformation.

This principle applies even to the spiritual gifts that are the workings of the Holy Spirit within us. These too must be given up and surrendered in a never-ending cycle of giving and receiving. If the believer becomes content with their gifts and blessings, the flow of new grace will slow down and their spiritual life will become stagnant. Only an empty soul that is continually thirsting for more of God will receive the constant inflow of living water. Each blessing received from God must be returned to Him through praise, love, self-sacrifice, and service. This is demonstrated in the story of Isaac on Moriah, who was a type of Jesus, who had to give up His life so that it could be received back in even greater power through resurrection. This same process occurs in the life of every believer as they move forward, forget the past, and reach out for a deeper understanding of Christ and His life.

The surrender of all for Christ is both a single step and a continuous journey. There may be a moment in a believer's life when they have a deeper understanding of this principle and, empowered by God's power, they willingly make a decision to offer their entire life as a sacrifice to God. This can often mark a turning point from a life of wandering and struggle to one of power and stability. But regardless of whether there is a defining moment, a believer's daily life should always involve seeking a deeper understanding of what it means to surrender all and continually offering everything they have to God.

Believer, if you want to remain in Christ, this is the only way. Self-denial and sacrifice may seem like a daunting task, but grace will make it possible and bring you joy and glory. Surrender yourself to Christ and the power of His presence will make it easy to let go of what was once precious to you. As Jesus promised, "A hundredfold in this life," will come true for those who accept His commands to give up all with wholehearted faithfulness. The blessings you receive will make the sacrifice even more blessed. The key to a close relationship with Christ is simple: as I give myself fully to Him, I gain the power to fully receive Him; as I lose myself and all I have for Him, He fully takes me for himself and gives himself fully to me.
