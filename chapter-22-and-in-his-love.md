# Chapter 22: And in His Love

_"As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: abide ye in my love."--John 15:9_

Dear Lord, please help us see the glory of this wonderful word. Open up your love to us so that our souls can enter and find their eternal home. How else can we know about a love that surpasses knowledge?

Before Jesus invites us to stay in His love, He first tells us what that love is. What He says about it should make us feel compelled to accept His invitation and make it impossible to refuse: “As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you!”

How can we understand the love that Jesus speaks of when He says “As the Father hath loved me”? Lord, please teach us. God is love. Love is not just an attribute of God, but it is His very essence. It’s what makes Him who He is. Love is the center around which all His glorious attributes gather. Because God is love, there must be a Father and a Son. The Father loves the Son with a divine passion that delights in Him and says “My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” The divine love is like a burning fire; it has only one object and one joy, which is the only-begotten Son. Even when we consider all of God’s attributes–His infinity, perfection, immensity, majesty, omnipotence–as rays of the glory of His love, we still can’t fully understand what that love must be like. It’s a love that surpasses knowledge.

Even so, the love that God has for His Son should be the mirror in which you learn how much Jesus loves you. As one of His redeemed ones, you are His delight. He desires you with a love that is stronger than death and that many waters cannot quench. His heart yearns for your fellowship and your love. If it were necessary, He could die again to have you. Just as the Father loved the Son and could not live without Him, so Jesus loves you. His life is bound up in yours; you are inexpressibly more indispensable and precious to Him than you can ever know. You are one with Him. “As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you.” What an amazing love!

It’s a love that lasts forever. Even before the world was created, God’s Word teaches us that Christ was meant to be the Head of His Church and have a body in which His glory could be shown. In that eternity, He loved and longed for those who had been given to Him by the Father. When He came and told His disciples that He loved them, it wasn’t just with a love of this earth and time but with the love of eternity. And it’s with that same infinite love that He still looks upon each of us here who seek to abide in Him. Every time He breathes out His love, there is indeed the power of eternity. “I have loved thee with an everlasting love.”

It’s a love that’s perfect. It gives everything and holds nothing back. “The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand.” And just like that, Jesus loves His own: everything He has is theirs. When it was necessary, He sacrificed His throne and crown for you. He didn’t think His own life and blood were too valuable to give for you. His righteousness, His Spirit, His glory, even His throne–all of it belongs to you. This love holds nothing back and makes you one with itself in a way that no human mind can understand. What an amazing love! To love us just as the Father loved Him and to offer us this love as our everyday dwelling.

It’s a gentle and tender love. When we think of the love of the Father for the Son, we see in the Son everything that’s infinitely worthy of that love. But when we think of Christ’s love for us, all we see is sin and unworthiness. And we wonder: How can that love within the divine life and its perfections be compared to the love that rests on sinners? Can it really be the same love? Thank God, we know it is. The nature of love is always one, no matter how different the objects. Christ knows no other law of love than that with which His Father loved Him. Our wretchedness only serves to bring out more clearly the beauty of love, such as could not even be seen in heaven. With the most tender compassion, He bows to our weakness; with unimaginable patience, He bears with our slowness; with the gentlest loving-kindness, He meets our fears and follies. It’s the Father’s love for the Son, beautified and glorified in its condescension and exquisite adaptation to our needs.

And it is an unchangeable love. ‘Having loved His own which were in the world, He loved them to the end.’ ‘The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed, but my kindness shall not depart from thee.’ The promise with which it begins its work in the soul is this: ‘I will not leave you until I have done what I have spoken to you of.’ And just as our wretchedness was what first drew it to us, so the sin, with which it is so often grieved, and which may well cause us to fear and doubt, is but a new motive for it to hold to us all the more. And why? We can give no reason but this: ‘As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you.’

And now, doesn’t this love suggest the reason, the extent, and the method of that surrender by which we give ourselves completely to abide in Him?

This love certainly provides a reason. Just look at how this love stands and pleads and prays. Gaze upon the divine form, eternal glory, heavenly beauty, and tenderly pleading gentleness of crucified love as it stretches out its pierced hands and says, “Oh, won’t you abide with me? Won’t you come and abide in me?” It points you up to the eternity of love from which it came to seek you. It points you to the Cross and all it has borne to prove the reality of its affection and to win you for itself. It reminds you of all it has promised to do for you if you just give yourself completely to it. It asks you if it has treated you well so far and if you have enjoyed being with it. And with a divine authority mixed with such an indescribable tenderness that you might almost think you hear a reproachful tone in it, it says, ‘Soul, as the Father has loved me, so I have loved you: stay in my love.’ There can only be one answer to such a plea: Lord Jesus Christ! Here I am. From now on, your love will be the only home of my soul: I will only stay in your love.

That love is not only the reason, but also the measure of our surrender to abide in it. Love gives everything but asks for everything in return. It does so not because it wants to take anything away from us but because it needs us to give ourselves completely to it so that it can fill us with its essence. This was true of the love between the Father and the Son. It was true of Jesus’ love for us. It must be true of our love for Him too. Our surrender to His love must have no other measure than His surrender to us. If only we understood how much love has in store for us! And how much we will gain by giving up everything for its sake! Or rather, if only we understood that this is a LOVE that surpasses all understanding! Then all thoughts of sacrifice or surrender would disappear, and our souls would be filled with wonder at the incredible privilege of being loved with such a love and being allowed to come and abide in it forever.

And if you doubt again and ask yourself: Is it possible? Can I always abide in His love? Listen to how that love itself provides the only means for abiding in Him. It is faith in that love that will enable us to abide in it. If this love is indeed so divine, such an intense and burning passion, then surely I can depend on it to keep me and hold me fast. Then surely all my unworthiness and feebleness can be no hindrance. If this love is indeed so divine, with infinite power at its command, I surely have a right to trust that it is stronger than my weakness; that with its almighty arm it will clasp me to its bosom and never let me go out again. I understand that this is the one thing that God requires of me. He treats me as a reasonable being with the power to choose. He cannot force me to accept His blessings but waits until I willingly give my heart to Him. The way I show this willingness is through faith - the faith that allows me to cast myself into His loving arms and be saved from sin and weakness. Oh, Infinite Love! The love that the Father had for the Son and the love that the Son has for us! I trust you and I will continue to trust you. Please keep me close to you.
