# Chapter 27: That You May Not Sin

_"He is without sin. Whoever remains in Him does not sin." 1 John 3:5,6_

"You know," the apostle said, "that Jesus was revealed to take away our sins," thus showing that salvation from sin is the main reason why the Son became human. The context makes it clear that the taking away refers not only to atonement and freedom from guilt, but also to liberation from the power of sin, so that believers no longer do it. It is Christ's personal holiness that enables Him to accomplish this purpose. He brings sinners into a living union with Himself; the result is that their lives become like His. "In Him is no sin. Whoever remains in Him does not sin." As long as they remain and to the extent that they remain, believers do not sin. Our holiness of life is rooted in the personal holiness of Jesus. "If the root is holy, so are the branches."

We must ask ourselves: How can this be reconciled with what the Bible teaches us about the persistent corruption of our human nature, or with what John himself says about the falsehood of our claims when we say that we have no sin or have not sinned (see I John 1:8, 10)? If we look closely at this passage, it will help us to understand the text correctly. Notice the difference between the two statements (verse 8): "If we say that we have no sin," and (verse 10): "If we say that we have not sinned." The two expressions cannot be the same; the second would then be an unnecessary repetition of the first. Having sin in verse 8 is not the same as doing sin in verse 10. Having sin is having a sinful nature, and even the most holy believer must admit that they have sin within them—the flesh, which contains nothing good. Doing sin is something different; it is giving in to our sinful nature and committing actual transgressions. So, every true believer must make two admissions. The first is that they still have sin within them (verse 8), and the second is that this sin has led to sinful actions in the past (verse 10). No believer can say either "I have no sin in me" or "I have never sinned in the past." If we say we have no sin in the present or that we have not sinned in the past, we are fooling ourselves. But we are not expected to confess to doing sin in the present—although it may be true, as chapter 2:2 suggests—only to sinning in the past. This way, we can understand how the deepest confession of sin in the past (like Paul's admission of being a persecutor) and the deepest awareness of still having a wicked and corrupt nature in the present can coexist with humble yet joyful praise to God, who keeps us from stumbling.

How is it possible for a believer to have sin in them yet not do sin? The answer is found in scripture: "In Him is no sin. He that abideth in Him sinneth not" (ESV). When the believer is in a close and unbroken relationship with the Lord, the power of the old nature is kept in check so that it does not take control. However, many Christians do not abide in Christ closely enough, so sin gains the upper hand and they become its subject. But if the believer claims the promise of scripture that "sin shall not have dominion over you" (ESV) in full faith and does not let sin reign in their mortal body, then sin is kept from asserting its supremacy. Ignorance, unbelief, and unwatchfulness can open the door for sin to reign. But when the believer seeks a permanent abode in Jesus, the Sinless One, then the life of Christ keeps them from actual transgression. Jesus saves them from sin, not by removing their sinful nature, but by keeping them from yielding to it.

I recently read about a young lion who could not be tamed by anything except the watchful eye of its keeper. With the keeper nearby, the lion would cower and tremble, its wild nature still intact and thirsting for blood. You could even put your foot on its neck as long as the keeper was there. To approach it without the keeper present would be a death sentence. In the same way, the believer can have sin but not commit sin. The evil nature, the flesh, still hates God, but the continual presence of Jesus keeps it in check. The believer must trust in the keeping and indwelling of the Son of God, abiding in Him and counting on Jesus to abide in them. The union and fellowship with God is the key to a holy life: "Whoever abides in Him does not sin" (1 John 3:6 ESV).

Now, another question arises: If it's true that abiding in the sinless one will keep us from sinning, is this possible? Can we hope to abide in Christ for even one day, so that we are kept from transgressing? If we consider this question fairly, the answer will become clear. When Christ commanded us to abide in Him and promised us such fruitful results that would bring glory to the Father, and such mighty power in our prayers, did He mean anything other than a healthy and vigorous union between the branch and the vine? When He promised that as we abide in Him, He would abide in us, did He mean anything other than His presence being a reality of divine power and love? Is this not the way to save us from sin and glorify Him? Keeping us humble and helpless in the knowledge of our evil nature, watchful and active in the knowledge of its power, and dependent and trusting in the remembrance that only His presence can keep the lion down? Let us believe that when Jesus said, "Abide in me, and I in you," He meant that although we can't be freed from the world and its tribulations, and from the sinful nature and its temptations, we can at least be sure of this blessing: grace to abide wholly and only in our Lord. Abiding in Jesus makes it possible to keep from sinning, and Jesus Himself makes it possible to abide in Him.

Dear Christian friend! I understand if the promise of this scripture seems too good to be true. Don't let yourself be distracted by the thought of whether it is possible to go your whole life, or for many years, without sinning. Faith only has to do with the present moment. Ask yourself: Can Jesus, right now, as I stay in Him, keep me from those sins that have been a stain and a burden in my daily life? You must answer: Yes, He can. So accept Him in this moment and say, "Jesus is keeping me now, Jesus is saving me now." Surrender yourself to Him in prayer, asking to be kept in Him through His presence in you. Then go into the next moment and the hours that follow with this trust renewed. Whenever you have a chance, renew your faith in an act of devotion: Jesus is keeping me now, Jesus is saving me now. Don't let failure and sin discourage you, but instead keep seeking your safety in the sinless one. Abiding in Him is a grace you can grow in if you make a full surrender and keep expecting more. Remember that it is His work to keep you in Him and to keep you from sinning. It is your work to stay in Him because it is His work as the Vine to bear and hold the branch. Look at His holy human nature and realize that there is something even better than being kept from sin—that is only avoiding evil. There is the positive and greater blessing of being purified and cleansed, of being filled with His fullness, and of showing His power, blessing, and glory.

"Let us strive to be like Jesus in all that we do. As it is written in Philippians 2:5, 'Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.' May we all strive to be humble and seek to serve others as Jesus did."

_Note: Is it unavoidable to sin every day?_

_Why do we so often feel fear and despair, despite having a Savior whose love and grace are infinite? We become weary and discouraged because we do not fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who is seated at the right hand of God—the One with omnipotent power over both heaven and earth, who is strong and mighty in His weak followers._

_As we remember our own weaknesses, we often forget about His all-powerful strength. We acknowledge that without Christ we can do nothing, yet we don't fully understand the depths of Christian humility: "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me" (Philippians 4:13). We trust in the power of Jesus' death to cancel our sin's guilt, yet we don't rely on the omnipotence of the living Savior to free us from sin's bondage and power in our daily lives. We forget that Christ works mightily in us and, with Him, we have enough strength to overcome every temptation. We either don't recognize our nothingness and think we can live without sin, or we don't take advantage of Jesus' omnipotence, who can subdue all things and keep us from our daily failures. If we truly depended on Christ for everything, we would always win through Him, whose power is infinite and who is appointed by the Father to be our salvation's leader. Then, all of our actions would be done in God, not just in front of Him. We would do all things to glorify the Father in the name of Jesus, who is our sanctification. Remember that all power is given to Him in heaven and on earth, and live by constantly exercising faith in His power. Let us fully believe that we are nothing, that it's impossible for us, and that we have no life that can bear fruit. But, that Christ is everything--abiding in Him and His word living in us, we can bring forth fruit to the glory of the Father._
