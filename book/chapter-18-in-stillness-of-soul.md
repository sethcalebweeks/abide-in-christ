# Chapter 18: In Stillness of Soul

_"In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and confidence shall be your strength."--Isaih 30:15_

_"Be silent to the Lord, and wait patiently for him."--Ps.37:7 (marg.)_

_"Truly my soul is silent unto God."--Ps.62:1 (marg.)_

There's a way some people view the Christian life as a partnership between God and man, where both have a part to play. They acknowledge that man's contribution is small and flawed due to sin, but believe that he must still do his best for God to do His part. This perspective makes it difficult for them to understand how Scripture teaches us to rest and wait for God's salvation. To these individuals, it seems contradictory to say that quietness and ceasing from all effort is the secret to man's highest activity and use of his abilities. However, Scripture does indeed teach this truth. The reason it appears to be a mystery is that the relationship between God and man is not a partnership where both equally contribute to a shared work. Rather, it's one of cooperation based on subordination. Just as Jesus was entirely dependent on the Father for all His works and words, believers can do nothing of themselves. Their self-efforts are entirely sinful. Therefore, they must stop their own doing and wait for God to work in them. As they surrender themselves to God, faith assures them that He works in them, renewing, sanctifying, and awakening their energies to their highest potential. The more a soul yields itself as a truly passive instrument in God's hands, the more it can be wielded by His almighty power. The person who experiences this wonderful combination of perfect passivity with the highest activity has the deepest understanding of what the Christian life is all about.

When we're seeking to abide in Christ, there's no lesson more vital and profitable than that of stillness of soul. Only in stillness can we develop the teachable spirit to which the Lord reveals His secrets and the meekness that allows Him to show us His ways. This spirit was exemplified beautifully in the three Marys. The first Mary responded to the most astounding revelation ever made to a human being with the words, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to Thy word." As mysteries multiplied around her, she kept them all and pondered them in her heart. The second Mary sat at Jesus' feet and listened to His word. She entered deeply into the mystery of His death, as shown by her anointing Him for His burial. The third Mary sought her Lord in the house of the Pharisee with tears that spoke louder than words. The best preparation for knowing Jesus and holding fast to His blessings is a soul that is silent before God. When we're hushed in silent awe and worship before the Holy Presence that reveals itself within us, we'll hear the still small voice of the blessed Spirit.

Beloved Christian, when you seek to understand the mystery of abiding in Christ, remember to first be silent before God. Your expectation should be from Him alone (Psalm 62:5). Do you truly hope to experience the union with the Heavenly Vine? Know that it is not possible for flesh and blood to reveal it to you, but only the Father in heaven. Cease from relying on your own wisdom, and confess your ignorance and helplessness. Then the Father will delight to teach you through the Holy Spirit. If you open your ears and submit your thoughts to Him, and prepare your heart to wait on God in silence, He will reveal His secrets to you. One of the first secrets you will learn is that as you become nothing before Him, in a stillness and silence of soul, you will hear teachings that you never heard before amidst the rush and noise of your own efforts. Your great work is to listen, hear, and believe what God promises, to watch, wait, and see what He does, and then in faith, worship, and obedience, yield yourself to His working.

It may seem that there is no more beautiful or welcome message than this, to rest and be quiet while God works for and in us. And yet, many are slow to learn that quietness is blessedness, strength, and the source of the highest activity. It is the secret to true abiding in Christ. Let us learn it and guard against whatever threatens our soul's rest. There are many dangers that can interfere with our quietness.

Sometimes we get too caught up in the things of this world, and it can distract us from our true purpose. We all have a divine calling, and it's important to take an interest in our work and surroundings within the boundaries set by God. But we need to be mindful and exercise self-control. We should be careful not to let even necessary things consume us so much that we have no energy left to connect with God. Worrying about earthly concerns can also wear down our trust and make our souls feel uneasy. In those moments, we might struggle to hear the quiet voice of the Holy Spirit.

It's also harmful to approach our spiritual journey with fear and distrust. This attitude can make it hard to truly listen to what God has to say. Most importantly, we need to avoid seeking spiritual blessings in our own way and with our own strength. When we try to do everything ourselves, we'll always fall short. We can get in the way of God's work. We need to learn to let go and trust Him to work in us. If we can do this, we can expect God to work powerfully within us and to guide us to fulfill His will.

Even when our soul seeks to enter the path of faith, our impatience with ourselves can cloud our judgment and cause us to evaluate our progress according to human standards rather than divine ones.

But there is hope for those who cultivate the discipline of stillness and trust in God's word: "In quietness and confidence shall be your strength" (ESV). Before reading the Bible or praying, take a moment to quiet your soul and humbly surrender to the Holy Spirit's guidance. Wait in silence until you are ready to receive the divine revelation of God's will and presence. Your reading and prayer will become a waiting on God with an open ear and heart, ready to receive only what He says.

"Abide in Christ!" Don't fool yourself into thinking you can do this without daily quiet time, meditation, and waiting on God. Cultivate a soul habit that finds peace amidst the distractions of the world, keeping your heart and mind fixed on God. Only in this calm and restful state can the life of faith take root, the Holy Spirit can provide blessed teaching, and the Holy Father can accomplish His glorious work. Every day, say to yourself, "Truly my soul is silent unto God." And if you struggle to attain this peace, simply trust in Him who makes the storm a calm. Cultivate quietness as a means of abiding in Christ, and expect the ever-deepening quietness and calm of heaven in your soul as the fruit of abiding in Him.
