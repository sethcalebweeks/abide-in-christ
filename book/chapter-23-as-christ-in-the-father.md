# Chapter 23: As Christ in the Father

_"As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love." - John, 15:9,10_

Jesus had taught His disciples that to abide in Him meant to abide in His love. His suffering was close and He couldn't speak much more to them. They probably had many questions about what it meant to abide in Him and His love. Before they could ask, He gave them HIS OWN LIFE as the best explanation for His command. As an example and rule for their staying in His love, they had to look to His staying in the Father's love. In the light of His connection with the Father, their connection with Him would become clear. His life in the Father is the law of their life in Him.

This thought is so profound that it can be difficult to understand, but it's also so clearly stated that we can't ignore it. In John 6:57, it says, "Just as I live because of the Father, so whoever eats me will live because of me." And Jesus specifically prays in John 17:22, "that they may be one just as we are one: I in them and You in me." The beautiful union of Jesus with the Father and His life in Him is the only guide for our thoughts and expectations about living and abiding in Him.

First, think about the beginning of Jesus' life in the Father. They were one--one in life and one in love. This is where His abiding in the Father had its roots. Even though He was living on earth, He knew He was one with the Father; that the Father's life was in Him and His love was on Him. Without this knowledge, abiding in the Father and His love would have been impossible. This is the only way you can abide in Jesus and His love. Understand that you are one with Him--one in the unity of nature. By His birth, He became man and took your nature so He could be one with you. By your new birth, you become one with Him and are made a partaker of His divine nature. The bond that connects you to Him is as real and close as the bond that connected Him to the Father--the bond of a divine life. Your claim on Him is as sure and always effective as His claim on the Father. Your union with Him is just as close.

And since it's a union of a divine life, it's one of an infinite love. During His time of humility on Earth, He experienced the joy and strength of knowing He was the object of an infinite love, and of living in it all the time. From His own example, He invites you to learn that this is the secret of peace and joy. You are one with Him: accept His love for you now; let your eyes and heart open to the love that shines and surrounds you. Abide in His love.

Think then too of the way that abiding in the Father and His love should be the law of your life. "I kept my Father's commandments and abide in His love." His was a life of obedience and reliance, yet it was incredibly blessed. Our own prideful self-seeking nature might see dependence and obedience as being humiliating and servile, but in the life of love that the Son of God lived and that He invites us to live, they are the secret to joy. The Son isn't worried about losing anything by giving everything to the Father, because He knows the Father loves Him and can have no other interests than those of the beloved Son. He knows that as dependent as He is, the Father is also completely giving Him all that He has. So when He said, "The Son can do nothing of Himself, except He see the Father do it," He immediately followed it with, "Whatsoever things the Father doeth, them also doeth the Son likewise: for the Father loveth the Son, and showeth Him all things that Himself doeth." The believer who studies this life of Christ as a model and the assurance of what their life can be, learns to understand how the "Without me ye can do nothing," is just the beginning of "I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me." We learn to take pride in our weaknesses, to take joy in our needs and hardships for Christ's sake; for "when I am weak, then am I strong." This believer goes above and beyond the ordinary way many Christians speak of their weakness, because they have learnt from Christ that in the life of divine love, emptying ourselves and sacrificing our will is the surest way of getting everything we wish or want. Obedience, submission, self-sacrifice are for the Christian, just like for Christ, the blessed path of life. Just like Christ lived through and in the Father, the believer lives through and in Christ.

Think of the greatness of this life of Christ in the Father's love. Because He devoted Himself completely to the Father's will and glory, the Father crowned Him with glory and honor. He acknowledged Him as His only representative; He gave Him the same power and authority; He lifted Him up to join His throne as God. And the same will happen with anyone who abides in Christ's love. If Christ finds us willing to trust ourselves and our needs to His love, if we surrender our own will and honor, if we take pride in relying completely on Him in all things, if we are content to have no life but in Him, He will do for us what the Father did for Him. He will share His glory with us: As the name of our Lord Jesus is glorified in us, we are glorified in Him (2 Thess.1:12). He recognizes us as His true and deserving representatives; He entrusts us with His power; He allows us to join His counsels, and permits our prayers to affect His rule of His Church and the world; He uses us as the means of His authority and His influence over people. His Spirit only lives in such places, and seeks no other tools for His divine work. What a blessed life of love for the soul that abides in Christ's love, just as He does in the Father's!

Believer, abide in the love of Christ. Take and study His relationship with the Father as proof of what your own can become. Just as blessed, powerful and glorious His life was in the Father, yours can be in Him. Let this truth, accepted with faith under the guidance of the Spirit, take away any fear of abiding in Christ being a burden or work. In the light of His life in the Father, let it be to you a blessed rest in the union with Him and an overflowing fountain of joy and strength. To abide in His love, His mighty, saving, keeping, satisfying love, just as He stayed in the Father's love - surely the greatness of our calling shows us that it can never be a work we need to do; it must be with us as with Him, the result of a life coming from within and the powerful influence of love from above. All we need is this: to take time and study the divine image of this life of love shown to us in Christ. We need to be still before God, gazing upon that life of Christ in the Father until the light from heaven shines on it, and we hear the living voice of our Beloved speaking softly to us personally the lesson He gave to the disciples. Soul, be still and listen; let every thought be silent until the word has entered your heart too: "Child! I love you, just as the Father loved me. Abide in my love, even as I abide in the Father's love. Your life on earth in me is to be the perfect copy of mine in the Father."

If the thought ever comes: "This is too much for us, can it really be true?", just remember that the privilege is justified by the greatness of the purpose He has in mind. Jesus was the revelation of the Father on earth. He could only be this because of the perfect unity, and the full communication between the Father and the Son. He could be this because the Father loved Him and He stayed in that love. Believers are the revelation of Jesus on earth. They can't be this unless there is perfect unity, so the world knows He loves them and has sent them. But they can be this if Jesus loves them with an infinite love that gives itself and all it has, and if they abide in that love.

Lord, show us Your love. Help us and all the saints understand the love that surpasses knowledge. Lord, show us in Your own blessed life what it means to abide in Your love. When we see it, it will be impossible for us to want anything else than to abide in Your love for even an hour.
