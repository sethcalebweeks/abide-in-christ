# Chapter 25: That Your Joy May Be Full

_"I have told you these things so that my joy may remain in you and that you may have complete joy." John 15:11_

Living completely in Christ brings an exquisite and abundant joy. As Christ takes more and more of our souls, we enter into the joy of our Lord. His joy, the joy of heaven, is ours too, and in full measure, and it never fades away. Just as joy on earth is often associated with the vine and its fruit, so joy is an essential part of the life of a believer who lives completely in Christ, the heavenly Vine (John 15:5).

We all understand the importance of joy. It is the only way to show that what we have truly brings us contentment. If I am only motivated by duty, self-interest, or other things, people cannot tell how much I value what I have. But when joy is present and they see me delight in it, they know that it is a treasure to me. This is why joy is so attractive, and no preaching is as powerful as a joyful heart. This is why joy is such a powerful part of the Christian character: there is no better way to show God's love and the blessings He brings than when joy overcomes all of life's trials. Joy is also essential for the Christian's own wellbeing: the joy of the Lord is their strength; confidence, courage, and patience are all inspired by joy. With a joyful heart, no work is too hard and no burden is too heavy; God is our strength and our song.

Let us listen to what the Saviour has to say about the joy of staying close to Him. He promises us His own joy: "My joy." This parable refers to the life His disciples should have in Him when He ascends to heaven, and the joy is that of His resurrection life. This is clear from His other words (John 16:22 ESV): "So you will have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you." It was only with the resurrection and its glory that the power of the never-changing life began, and only in it that the never-ending joy could be found. This is fulfilled in the words: "Therefore your God has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions." The day of His crowning was the day of His gladness. That joy was the joy of a work fully and forever completed, the joy of regaining the Father's embrace, and the joy of redeemed souls. These are the elements of His joy; when we abide in Him, we become partakers of them. The believer shares so fully in His victory and perfect redemption that their faith can continually sing the song of the conqueror: "Thanks be to God, who always leads me to triumph!" As a result of this, there is the joy of living in the light of the Father's love, without a single cloud if the abiding is unbroken. And then, with this joy in the love of the Father, as a love received, the joy of loving souls, as love going out and rejoicing over the lost. Abiding in Christ, going into the depths of His life and heart, striving for the most perfect unity, these three streams of His joy flow into our hearts. Whether we look back and see the work He has done, or upward and see the reward He has in the Father's love that surpasses knowledge, or forward in the continual additions of joy as sinners are brought home, His joy is ours. With our feet on Calvary, our eyes on the Father's face, and our hands helping sinners home, we have His joy as our own.

Then Jesus speaks of this joy as never-ending--a joy that will never cease or be interrupted: "That my joy may remain in you." "Your joy no one will take from you." Many Christians cannot understand this. They think the Christian life is a series of changes, with joy and sorrow alternating. They point to the experiences of someone like the Apostle Paul as an example of how much sorrow and suffering there can be. They don't realize how Paul actually provides the strongest evidence of this unceasing joy. He understood the paradox of the Christian life as the combination of both the hardships of this world and the joy of heaven. As the Bible says, "We are sorrowful, yet always rejoicing" (2 Corinthians 6:10). This teaches us how the joy of Christ can overpower the sorrow of the world, and how we can sing even while we weep. It also shows us how, even when we are knocked down by disappointment or difficulty, we can still have a deep sense of joy that is indescribable and glorious. The only condition is, "I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you" (John 16:22). When Jesus is clearly present, joy is inevitable. When we abide in Him, how can we not be glad? Even when we are weeping for the sins and souls of others, we can still have faith in His power and love to save, and that will bring us joy.

Our Savior wants us to experience the full joy of abiding in Him. On the last night, He spoke three times of this joy. In the parable of the Vine, He said, “These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you” (John 15:11 ESV). Every time we gain a deeper understanding of being a branch of the Vine, His words are confirmed. He also said that when we ask, we will receive, so that our joy may be full (John 16:24 ESV). To a spiritual mind, answered prayer is not just a way to obtain blessings, but something much greater. It is a sign of our fellowship with the Father and the Son in heaven, of their delight in us, and of our having been admitted to the wonderful exchange of love in which the Father and the Son consult and decide the daily guidance of the children on earth. For a soul that abides in Christ and longs to experience His love, an answered prayer is an expression of love and trust from the throne, and the joy it brings is beyond words. As Jesus prayed to the Father (John 17:13 ESV), “These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.” Let the believer who seeks, according to John 15, to possess the full joy of abiding in Christ and, according to John 16, the full joy of prevailing prayer, press forward to John 17. Let him listen to the intercessory words spoken, so that his joy may be full. As he listens to these words, let him learn the love that pleads for him in heaven continually, the glorious things it pleads for, and how, through its all-prevailing pleading, these things are being realized every hour. Then Christ's joy will be fulfilled in him.

Believers who stay close to Christ have access to His joy, an everlasting joy that is full and complete. But why is it that this joy doesn't seem to draw people in? It's because people, even God's children, don't believe in it. Instead of seeing abiding in Christ as the most fulfilling life, they think it's a life of self-denial and sadness. They don't realize that the self-denial and sadness come from not abiding in Christ, and that those who give themselves completely to abiding in Him will find that their faith is rewarded—the joy of the Lord is theirs. The problems come from not making a full commitment to abiding in Him.

Child of God, if you are seeking to abide in Christ, remember what the Lord says. At the end of the parable of the Vine, He adds these precious words: "These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full" (ESV). Receive joy as part of the life of a branch--not the primary or most important part, but as a blessed evidence of Christ's ability to fulfill every need of the soul. Be happy. Cultivate gladness. If there are times when joy comes naturally and the heart feels the inexpressible joy of the Saviour's presence, thank God for it, and strive to maintain it. If at other times your feelings are dull and the experience of joy is not what you would like it to be, still thank God for the life of inexpressible blessedness to which you have been redeemed. In this, too, the word holds true: "According to your faith be it unto you" (ESV). As you claim all the other gifts in Jesus, always claim this one too--not for your own sake, but for His and the Father's glory. These are Jesus' own words: "My joy in you"; "that my joy may abide in you"; "my joy fulfilled in themselves" (ESV). It is impossible to take Him wholly and sincerely, and not to get His joy too. Therefore, "Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, rejoice" (ESV).
