# Chapter 26: And in Love to the Brethren

_"This is my command to you: love each other as I have loved you." John 15:12_

"Just as the Father loved me, so I have loved you; and just as I have loved you, so you must love one another." God became human; divine love began to flow through a human heart; it became the love of one person to another. The love that fills heaven and eternity is to be seen here on earth and in our daily lives.

"This is my commandment," Jesus said, "Love one another just as I have loved you." He often spoke of commands, but the love that fulfills the law is the most important one and is therefore referred to as His commandmentâ€”the new commandment. It is to be a sign of the reality of the New Covenant and the power of the new life revealed in Jesus Christ. It is to be the one undeniable sign of being a disciple: "This is how everyone will know that you are my disciples"; "That they may be one in us, so that the world may believe"; "That they may be perfected in unity, so that the world may know that You have loved them just as You have loved me." For the believer who seeks perfect fellowship with Christ, keeping this commandment is both the blessed proof that they are abiding in Him and the path to a deeper and more perfect union.

Let us try to understand how this is so. We know that God is love, and that Christ came to reveal this, not as a doctrine but as a life. His life, with its amazing humility and self-sacrifice, was, more than anything else, a demonstration of divine love, showing people, in a way they could comprehend, how God loves. In His love for the undeserving and the ungrateful, in His humbling Himself to walk among us as a servant, in His giving Himself up to death, He simply lived out and acted the life of the divine love that was in the heart of God. He lived and died to show us the love of the Father.

Now, just as Jesus displayed God's love to the world, believers are to show the love of Christ. They must demonstrate to people that Christ loves them and fills them with a love that is not of this world. By living and loving as He did, they are to be living reminders of the love that sacrificed itself for us. He loved so much that even the Jews exclaimed at Bethany, "Look how much He loved!" Christians should live in such a way that people are compelled to say, "Look how these Christians love one another." Through their daily interactions, Christians are a spectacle to God, angels, and men; and by exhibiting Christlike love for each other, they prove what kind of spirit they possess. Despite differences in character or beliefs, language or social status, Christians must show that love has made them members of one body and has taught them to forget and sacrifice themselves for the benefit of others. Their life of love is the primary evidence of Christianity, the proof to the world that God sent Jesus and has poured out His love into their hearts (Romans 5:5). Of all the proofs of Christianity, this is the most powerful and convincing.

The love of Christ's disciples for one another is a crucial part of their relationship with God and with all people. It is the test of their love for God, whom they cannot see. Loving one another proves that their love for God is real and true. It is the fruit of the root of love for God in their hearts. This love for one another also becomes the seed of love for all people. Interacting with each other is how believers learn and grow in their ability to love those who are not yet in Christ, even those they don't agree with. It is love for one another as disciples that binds together love for God and love for all people.

In Christ's relationship with His disciples, brotherly love sets the standard for how we should interact with one another. We can look to Jesus for an example of how to forgive and be patient with our friends, with no limit to how many times we should forgive. He also showed us how to be humble and serve one another. He said, "As I have done, so you must do" (John 13:15). Following His example, we should live for the benefit of others rather than ourselves. We should be kind in our words, never speaking unkindly. We should also refuse to hear or think evil of our fellow Christians, being more protective of their name and character than our own. We should leave our own good name to the Father, but be responsible for protecting our brother's good name. The love of God that is in us should be evident in our lives, just as it was in the life of Jesus, through gentleness, kindness, courtesy, generosity, self-sacrifice, and beneficence.

Christian, what do you think of your incredible calling to love like Christ? Does your heart leap at the thought of this incomparable privilege of reflecting the love of the Eternal? Or do you rather sigh at the thought of the impossible level of perfection to which you are called? Brother, don't sigh at what is truly the highest sign of the Father's love: that He has called us to be like Christ in our love, just as He was like the Father in His love. Realize that the One who gave this command in connection with His teaching about the Vine and abiding in Him, gave us the assurance that we just need to remain in Him to be able to love like Him. Accept the command as a new incentive to stay more deeply connected to Christ. Consider abiding in Him even more as abiding in His love; rooted and grounded daily in a love that surpasses understanding, you will receive its fullness and learn to love. With Christ abiding in you, the Holy Spirit will spread God's love in your heart, and you will love your brothers and sisters, even the most challenging and unlovable, with a love that is not your own, but the love of Christ in you. And the command to love your brothers and sisters will turn from a burden into a joy, if you keep it linked, just as Jesus linked it, to the command about His love for you: "Abide in my love; love one another, as I have loved you."

"This is my commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you." Is not this now some of the abundant fruit that Jesus promised we would bear--truly a cluster of grapes from Eshcol, with which we can show others that the land of promise is indeed a good land? Let us try with all sincerity and integrity to bring the language of strong faith and divine enthusiasm into the everyday life of our homes, so that everyone can understand it. Let Jesus be the one to control our temper--He can not only restrain it, He can make us gentle and patient. Let us confidently place the vow that no unkind words about others will ever come from our lips at His feet. Let us be marked by gentleness that refuses to take offense, that is always ready to forgive, to think and hope the best in our interactions with everyone. Let us strive for love that does not seek its own interests, but is always ready to serve others, or even to give its life for them, as we remain in Jesus. Let our life be one of self-sacrifice, always considering the welfare of others, and finding our greatest joy in blessing them. And let us, as we learn the divine art of doing good, submit ourselves as obedient students to the guidance of the Holy Spirit. By His grace, even the most ordinary life can be transformed with heavenly beauty, as the infinite love of the divine nature shines through our fragile humanity. Fellow Christian, let us give thanks to God! We are called to love as Jesus loves, as God loves.

"Remain in my love and love as I have loved." Praise God, it is possible! The new holy nature we have, and which grows ever stronger as it remains in Christ the Vine, can love as He did. Every recognition of the wickedness of the old nature, every strong desire to obey the command of our Lord, every experience of the power and the joy of loving with Jesus' love, will encourage us to accept with renewed faith the blessed commands: "Remain in me, and I in you"; "Abide in my love."
