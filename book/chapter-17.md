# Chapter 17: Through the Holy Spirit

_But the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about everything, and is true, and is no lie—just as it has taught you, abide in him. 1 John 2:27_

Imagine living a life fully connected to Christ! The more you think about it, the more appealing it becomes. Yet, too often we hear the words "abide in me" with a sense of frustration. We don't fully understand what they mean, or how to truly experience this intimate connection. But what if we had a guide to help us grasp it? Someone to clarify and remind us that this closeness is within reach. That's exactly what John offers us in his teachings. He gives us the divine promise that the Holy Spirit is here to teach us everything, including how to remain in Christ. This should bring us hope and joy!

But, oh! You might say, this message doesn't bring me comfort, it only makes me feel worse. It speaks of a privilege that I know so little about: I don't understand how the Spirit teaches us or how to recognize His voice. No wonder I can't fully grasp the promise of His guidance on how to remain in Christ. If the Teacher is such a mystery to me, how can I benefit from His teachings?

This type of thinking comes from a common misconception among believers. They believe that the Holy Spirit must first reveal the mysteries of the spiritual life to their minds before they can experience it. But in reality, it's the opposite. This is especially true for the concept of remaining in Christ. We must live and experience the truth in order to truly know it. Life-fellowship with Jesus is the only way to understand spiritual things. In the Kingdom of God, it's normal to not understand everything at first, but to receive, submit, and accept what you can't comprehend. Believe in what seems impossible and walk in a way that you don't understand - these are the first lessons in the school of God. If you remain in His word, you will eventually understand the truth. True discipleship involves following the Lord first, then knowing Him. Surrendering to Christ and submitting to His word, even when it seems improbable, is the only way to truly know Him and experience full blessings.

These principles apply especially to the teaching of the Holy Spirit. This teaching involves guiding our spiritual life to what God has prepared for us, without us always knowing how. With trust in God's promise and faithfulness, we yield to the leading of the Holy Spirit, without trying to understand everything first. Instead, we allow the Holy Spirit to work within us and then later know what He has done. Faith trusts in the unseen work of the Spirit within us. The word of Christ and the gift of the Spirit are enough to guarantee that we will be taught by the Spirit to remain in Christ. We rejoice in what we cannot see or feel, knowing that the Holy Spirit is working within us, guiding us to a life of full and unbroken communion. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life in Christ, and it is His work to breathe new life into us, foster it, and perfect it. The more we yield to the law of the Spirit of life working within us, the more our faith will turn into knowledge, and the Spirit's light will reveal what has already been accomplished through the Spirit's power in our life.

Let's apply this to the promise of the Spirit teaching us to abide in Christ. The Holy Spirit is the mighty power of God and he comes to us from the heart of Christ, bringing his life to us and revealing and communicating Christ to us. The phrase "fellowship of the Spirit" shows us the importance of his role. He is the bond that unites the Father and the Son, unites all believers, and most importantly, unites Christ and believers. He is the life-giving connection between the Vine and the branch, making us one. We can be confident that if we believe in his presence, avoid grieving him, and pray to be filled with him, he will teach us how to abide in Christ. He will guide our will towards a complete devotion to Christ, strengthen our faith, and bring peace and joy to our hearts. He will teach us to abide without us even realizing how. He will bring the truth to our understanding, not just as a thought, but as the truth in Christ Jesus, reflecting the light of what he has already made real in our lives. "The life was the light of men."

With this understanding, it's clear that if we want the Spirit to guide us into an abiding life, our first step is to have quiet and peaceful faith. No matter the questions or difficulties that may arise, the longing for guidance, or the sense of failure, ignorance, or helplessness, we must hold on to the confidence that the Holy Spirit will teach us to abide in Christ. "The anointing you received from him abides in you, and you don't need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit—just as it has taught you, abide in him." Make this a focus of your faith. Believe that you have the Spirit as surely as you have a place in Christ, and he will work with power if you don't hinder him. Believe that he is working, even when you can't see it. Believe that he will work mightily if you ask the Father. To live an abiding life, you must be full of the Spirit, and you can have this daily. Take time in prayer to be at the throne of God and the Lamb, where the river of life flows, and that's where you'll be filled with the Spirit. Cultivate a daily habit of honoring the Spirit with quiet confidence that he's working within you. Let your faith in his indwelling protect you from anything that might grieve him—the spirit of the world or your own fleshly desires. Nourish your faith with the Word and all it says about the Spirit, his power, comfort, and work. Most of all, let your faith in the Spirit's indwelling lead you to look to Jesus. As we receive the anointing from him, it becomes even stronger as we focus on him alone. Christ is the Anointed One, and as we look to him, the holy anointing flows down, like the precious oil on Aaron's head that reached the hem of his garments. It's faith in Jesus that brings the anointing, and the anointing leads us to Jesus and to abiding in him alone.

Believer, abide in Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit! Why should abiding in Christ be seen as a burden or a fear? Of course not! If we just knew how loving and comforting the Holy Spirit is, and how amazing it is to fully surrender to His guidance, we would surely experience the divine comfort of having such a teacher to keep us close to Christ. The Holy Spirit was given to us for one purpose only: to bring the glorious redemption and life in Christ to us with divine power. The Holy Spirit is the one who makes the living Christ, with all His saving power and complete victory over sin, always present within us. This is what makes Him the Comforter. With the Holy Spirit, we will never have to grieve over an absent Christ. So, every time we read, meditate, or pray about abiding in Christ, let's be confident that we have the Spirit of God within us, teaching, guiding, and working. Let's rejoice in the belief that we will succeed in our desire to abide, because the Holy Spirit is working constantly and secretly with divine power in our soul, as long as we don't hinder Him with our unbelief.
