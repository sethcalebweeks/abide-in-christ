# Chapter 28: As Your Strength

_"I have been given all power in heaven and on earth." Matthew 28:18_
_"The word 'power' in this verse is properly translated as 'authority' (English Standard Version), but these two concepts are so closely connected and the authority as a living divine reality is so inseparable from the power that I feel it is appropriate to keep the word 'power'."_

_"Be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power" Ephesians 6:10_

_"My strength is perfected in frailty." 2 Corinthians 12:9_

All serious followers of Christ recognize their complete helplessness. However, this truth is often misunderstood and misused. God's ways of thinking are far above what humans can comprehend.

The Christian often tries to ignore their weaknesses, but God wants us to recognize and embrace them. We may want to be free from them, but God wants us to find peace and joy in them. We may mourn our weaknesses, but Christ teaches us to be glad in our weaknesses. We may think our weaknesses are a barrier to living and serving God, but God tells us that they are the key to strength and success. When we accept and understand our weaknesses, we can access the strength of God, who said, "My power is made perfect in weakness" (2 Corinthians 12:9).

As Jesus was preparing to ascend to the throne, He declared, "All power is given unto me in heaven and on earth" (Matthew 28:18). This was a new and true reality, a breakthrough in the story of the God-man. He was now entrusted with omnipotence, so that through human nature its mighty energies could be unleashed. He connected this revelation with a promise to His disciples: "When I am ascended, you will receive power from on high" (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:8). We must find our strength for life and work in the omnipotent power of the Saviour.

The disciples experienced the same thing. For ten days, they worshiped and waited at the foot of Jesus' throne. They expressed their faith in Him as their Savior, their adoration of Him as their Lord, their love for Him as their Friend, and their devotion and readiness to work for Him as their Master. Jesus Christ was the only thing they thought about, loved, and delighted in. Through this worship of faith and devotion, their souls grew closer to Him on the throne, and when they were ready, the baptism of power came. It was power within them and power around them.

The power of God came to equip them for the work they had committed to--to testify to their unseen Lord through their words and lives. For some, the main testimony was to be a holy life, showing the world the heaven and Christ from which it came. The power of God enabled them to establish His Kingdom within them, giving them victory over sin and themselves, and helping them to testify to the power of Jesus on the throne, to live as saints in the world. Others gave themselves entirely to speaking in the name of Jesus. But all of them needed and received the gift of power, to prove that now Jesus had received the Kingdom of the Father, all power in heaven and earth was indeed given to Him, and by Him imparted to His people as they needed it, whether for a holy life or effective service. They received the gift of power, to prove to the world that the Kingdom of God, to which they belonged, was not just in words but in power. By having power within, they had power without and around them. Even those who would not yield to it felt the power of God (Acts 2:43; 4:13; 5:13).

Jesus is just as much our Lord and Savior as He was for the first disciples. His power is absolute and He works through us with that same power. Everything we receive from Him is powerful and every blessing, promise, and grace is fulfilled by His power. Even the weakest believer can trust that Jesus will answer their prayers with divine power. Jesus is ours and His power is in us and it is through us that His power is made known.

If we want to understand how Christ gives us His power, the answer is straightforward: He does so by giving us His life. He does not take our weak life and give us a bit of strength to help us in our feeble attempts. No, it is by giving us His own life that He gives us His power. The Holy Spirit descended on the disciples directly from the Lord's exalted heart, bringing with Him the glorious life of heaven into which He had entered. Therefore, His people are still taught to be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. When He strengthens them, He does not take away their sense of weakness and replace it with strength. Instead, He leaves and even increases their sense of utter helplessness, and gives them the awareness of strength in Him. "We have this treasure in jars of clay, so that the surpassing greatness of the power may be of God and not from us." The weakness and the strength exist side by side, and as one grows, so does the other, until they understand the saying, "When I am weak, then I am strong; I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me."

The disciple of faith learns to view Christ on the throne, Christ the Almighty, as their life. They contemplate this life with its infinite perfection and purity, its strength and glory; it is the eternal life dwelling in a glorified person. When they reflect on their own inner life and crave holiness, to live in a way that pleases God, or to have the strength to do the Father's work, they look up, rejoicing that Christ is their life, and trustingly believe that this life will work powerfully in them to give them all they need. In small and large matters, whether it is the need to be kept from sin in each moment or the battle against a particular trial or temptation, the power of Christ is the limit of their expectation. They live a life of great joy and blessing, not because they are no longer weak, but because, being utterly powerless, they agree and anticipate that the mighty Savior will work in them.

The lessons we can learn from these thoughts for our daily lives are simple, yet invaluable. The first is that all our strength is found in Christ, stored and ready for us to use. It is there as an almighty life, which is in Him for us, ready to flow in according to the measure in which it finds the channels open. Whether its flow is strong or weak, whatever our experience of it is, it is in Christ: He has "all authority in heaven and on earth" (Matthew 28:18). Let us take time to ponder this. Let us fill our minds with the thought: The Father gave Jesus all power so that He could be a perfect Savior for us. That is the qualification that fits Him for our needs: All the power of heaven over all the powers of earth, and over every power of earth in our hearts and lives too.

The second lesson is this: As we stay in close union with Him, His power flows into us. If we don't value or cultivate this union, we won't receive much strength. But if we make Him our highest good and sacrifice everything to maintain this union, His power will work: "His strength will be made perfect in our weakness" (2 Corinthians 12:9). Our focus should be on staying in Christ as our strength. We must be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might (Ephesians 6:10). Let us have faith in the greatness of God's power in us believers, the power of the risen and exalted Christ who conquered every enemy (Ephesians 1:19-21). Let us accept God's wonderful and blessed arrangement: we are weak, but all the power is in Christ and we can access it as if it were in us. Let us daily leave our own life and enter into the life of Christ, allowing Him to work in us. Most importantly, let us trust that He will indeed perfect His work in us with His almighty power. As we stay in Christ, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of His power, will work powerfully in us and we will be able to sing, "Jehovah is my strength and song; in Jehovah I have righteousness and strength" (Exodus 15:2) and "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me" (Philippians 4:13).
