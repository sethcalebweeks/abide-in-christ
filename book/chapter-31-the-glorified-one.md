# Chapter 31: The Glorified One

_"Your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, our life, is revealed, you too will be revealed with Him in glory." Colossians 3:3-4_

Whoever remains in Christ, the Crucified One, learns to know what it is to be crucified with Him and to be truly dead to sin. Whoever remains in Christ, the Risen and Glorified One, also becomes a partaker of His resurrection life and of the glory with which He is now crowned in heaven. The blessings that come from being united with Jesus in His glorified life are beyond words.

This life is one of total victory and serenity. Before His death, the Son of God had to suffer and struggle, could be tempted and troubled by sin and its attacks: as the Risen One, He has conquered sin; and, as the Glorified One, His humanity has been given a share in the glory of God. The believer who remains in Him as such, is shown how the power of sin and the flesh are truly destroyed: the awareness of complete and everlasting deliverance becomes more and more clear, and the blessed rest and peace, the result of such a realization that victory and deliverance are a done deal, take over the life. Remaining in Jesus, in whom he has been raised and seated in the heavenly realms, he receives of the glorious life flowing from the Head through every member of the body.

This life is one of full communion with the Father's love and holiness. Jesus often emphasized this to His disciples. His death was a return to the Father. He prayed, “Glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began” (John 17:5). As the believer, abiding in Jesus the Glorified One, seeks to understand and experience the implications of their union with Jesus on the throne, they come to understand how the Father's presence is the highest glory and blessing, and is also the believer's portion. They learn the sacred art of always, in fellowship with their exalted Head, dwelling in the Father's presence. Furthermore, while Jesus was on earth, He was still vulnerable to temptation, but in glory, everything is holy and in perfect accord with God's will. Thus, the believer who abides in Him experiences that in this high fellowship their spirit is sanctified to be increasingly in harmony with the Father's will. The heavenly life of Jesus is the power that casts out sin.

This life is one of loving kindness and action. Seated on His throne, Jesus gives His gifts, pours out His Spirit, and never stops loving and working for those who belong to Him. When believers stay close to Jesus the Glorified One, they are stirred and strengthened to work: the Spirit and the love of Jesus fill them with the will and power to be a blessing to others. Jesus went to heaven to get the power to bless abundantly. He does this as the heavenly Vine only through His people as His branches. So, whoever abides in Him, the Glorified One, produces much fruit, for they receive the Spirit and the power of Jesus' exalted eternal life, and become the channel through which the fullness of Jesus, who was exalted to be a Prince and a Savior, flows out to bless those around them.

Christ sits at the right hand of God, eagerly awaiting the day when His enemies will be defeated and His glory will be revealed. He looks forward to the time when He will be fully rewarded. He also looks forward to the joy of being reunited with His beloved people, as promised in John 14:3: "And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also." The anticipation of this reunion is just as sweet to Him as it is to us. His life in glory is one of longing expectation, for His full glory will only be realized when His beloved are with Him.

The believer who remains close to Christ will share in His spirit of anticipation. Not for the purpose of increasing personal happiness, but out of a spirit of passionate loyalty to their King, they long to see Him come in His glory, ruling over every enemy, and the full manifestation of God's everlasting love. "Until He comes" is the motto of every true-hearted believer. "Christ will appear, and we will appear with Him in glory" (Colossians 3:4).

There may be strong disagreements about how the Bible speaks of Jesus’ return. For some, Jesus is coming soon in person to rule on earth, and this hope gives them strength. For others, Jesus’ return is the Day of Judgment, the end of this world and the start of the next, and the thought of Jesus appearing in glory is their joy and strength. No matter what, Jesus coming again and taking us to himself is the focus of the Church’s hope.

It is by living in Christ, the Glorified One, that believers will be awakened to a truly spiritual longing for His coming, which is the only thing that can bring true blessing to the soul. There is a fascination with studying what is to come, in which the teachings of a school are often more valued than the teachings of Christ, the meek one; in which arguments for opinions and criticism of fellow believers are more prominent than any signs of the coming glory. It is only humility that is willing to learn from those who may have different gifts and a deeper understanding of the truth than we, and love that always speaks gently and kindly of those who don't see things the same way, and a heavenly mindset that shows the Coming One is already our life, that will convince either the Church or the world that our faith is not in human wisdom, but in the power of God. To testify of the Saviour as the Coming One, we must be living in and reflecting the image of Him as the Glorified One. It is not the accuracy of the views we hold, nor the enthusiasm with which we promote them, that will prepare us to meet Him, but only living in Him. Then, and only then, can our being revealed in glory with Him be what it is meant to be - a transformation, a bursting out and shining of the indwelling glory that had been waiting for the day of revelation.

What a blessed life! We are "hidden with Christ in God," "seated in the heavenly places in Christ," and abiding in Christ the glorified! We might ask ourselves: Can a mere mortal really live in fellowship with the King of glory? The answer is yes! Christ has all power in heaven and on earth to make this possible. All we have to do is trust Him and continually yield ourselves to Him. This act of faith, though simple, is incredibly powerful. As we trust Him more, we gain a clearer understanding of the truth that we are one with Him in His glory. We learn to rely entirely on the keeping of Christ's almighty power and the workings of His eternal life. Knowing that we have the Spirit of God living within us, we don't see it as a burden, but rather let the divine life take over. In this faith, our fellowship with Christ remains unbroken and our conformity to Him grows. Just like Moses, we become partakers of His glory, and our lives begin to shine with a brilliance that doesn't come from this world.

What a blessed life we have, for Jesus is ours! We have the power of this life within us, hidden, and the glorious prospect it holds before us. May our daily lives be a bright and blessed proof that this hidden power dwells within, preparing us for the glory to be revealed. May our abiding in Christ, the Glorified One, be our power to live for the glory of the Father and our readiness to share in the glory of the Son.

Now, my dear children, remain in Him so that when He appears, we will have boldness and not be ashamed before Him when He comes.
