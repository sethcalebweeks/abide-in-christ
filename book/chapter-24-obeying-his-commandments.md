# Chapter 24: Obeying His Commandments

_"If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I obeyed my Father's commands and remain in his love." - John 15:10._

It is made clear to us how important good works are in the life of a believer! Christ, as the beloved Son, was in the Father's love because He kept His commandments. Similarly, when a sinner comes to Christ, they are not saved by works, but rather by faith. Yet, once they are in Christ, good works are essential for perfecting faith, strengthening the union with Christ, and deepening the soul's connection with God's love. As Jesus said, "If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him" (John 14:23). And, "If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love" (John 15:10).

The relationship between following God's commands and living in Christ's love is clear. Our connection with Jesus Christ is not just intellectual or emotional, but a real and vital relationship in our hearts and lives. The Holy Spirit breathes the holy life of Jesus, with His feelings and attitudes, into us. As believers, we are called to think, feel, and do what Jesus thought, felt, and did. We desire to be not only recipients of grace, but also of His holiness, which is the most beautiful aspect of grace. To live like Christ means to be freed from living for ourselves; the will of Christ is the only way to be liberated from the bondage of our sinful self-will.

For the ignorant or lazy believer, there is a big difference between the promises and commands of Scripture. The former they see as a source of comfort and nourishment, but for the one truly seeking to remain in Christ's love, the commands become just as precious. They are a revelation of divine love, guiding us into a deeper experience of the divine life, and helping us on our path to a closer union with the Lord. We can see how our will being in harmony with His will is a major part of our fellowship with Him. The will is the most important part of both the divine and human being. How can we have fellowship with Him without delighting in His will? As long as salvation is seen as nothing more than personal safety, we can be careless or afraid of doing God's will. But when it is seen as Scripture and the Holy Spirit reveal it to be--restoration to communion with God and conformity to Him--we understand that there is no law more natural or beautiful than this: obeying Christ's commands is the way to remain in His love. Our innermost soul agrees when we hear our beloved Lord make the greater measure of the Spirit, with the manifestation of the Father and the Son in the believer, completely dependent on obeying His commands (John 14:15,16,21,23).

There is something else that allows us to gain a deeper understanding and more fully accept this truth. That is, Jesus Himself was only able to abide in the Father's love by living a life of obedience. He was tempted just like us, and He had to fast and pray to resist. He spoke of not seeking to do His own will, but instead keeping the Father's commandments as the focus of His life. He said, “I do nothing on my own, but I say only what the Father taught me. The one who sent me is with me; He has not left me alone, because I always do what pleases Him.” Jesus showed us the only way to experience a life on earth in the love of heaven. When we allow His Spirit to flow through us, keeping the commands is one of the most important elements of the life He gives us.

Believer, if you want to stay close to Jesus, be sure to obey His commands. Don't just read them in the Bible, but let them sink into your heart through study, meditation, prayer, and the Spirit's teaching. Don't just know the most common commands; make sure you know them all. Like the Old Testament saints said, "I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right" (Psalm 119:128). There's still much of God's will that you don't understand yet. Pray for wisdom and understanding of His will, like Paul did for the Colossians (Colossians 1:9) and Epaphras did (Colossians 4:12). Remember, understanding God's will is part of spiritual growth. After you've dedicated yourself to God (Romans 12:1), you need to keep renewing your mind to know what is good, perfect, and pleasing to Him (Romans 12:2). As you grow closer to Christ, you'll develop a spiritual instinct that will help you recognize and apply God's commands to your daily life. Keep them in your heart and you'll experience the joy of the one whose "delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law doth he meditate day and night" (Psalm 1:2). Love will transform the commands into a living power that's in harmony with all that God requires.

Vow to yourself to never again tolerate any sin, and keep it in the obedience of your life. You have promised, and you will fulfill it, to obey God's righteous judgments. Pray earnestly to stand perfect and complete in all of God's will. Ask for the revelation of any hidden sin that is not in harmony with God's will. Walk in the light you have faithfully and tenderly, and surrender yourself completely to obey all that the Lord has commanded. When Israel made this vow (Exodus 19:8, 24:7), they would soon break it. But the New Covenant gives us the grace to make the vow and keep it (Jeremiah 31). Even in small things, be careful to not disobey. Disobedience dulls the conscience, darkens the soul, and weakens our spiritual energy, so keep the commandments of Christ with full obedience. Be a soldier that only follows the orders of the commander.

If the commandments ever seem difficult, remember that they come from a loving God. They are rooted in love and lead to a deeper understanding of His love. Every time you choose to obey the commandments, you will be rewarded with a closer relationship with the Savior and a greater resemblance to His life. You will come to treasure these words: “If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and remain in His love” (John 15:10).
